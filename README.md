# Native American Village Mod for Minetest!

**!!! This is not supposed to be historically correct or target any Nation or tribe, it is definitely not intended to be detrimental in any way shape or form. If anything this is for fun and a cross bred love based on an over mediatized and glorified Hollywood image and growing up in a family that participated in large charity organized re-enactments, yes I got dressed up and shot a lot as a kid. On the other hand, I have no objections to advice to make this as authentic as possible,  !!!**

**!!! Special thanks to TenPlus1 it's thanks to your mods and API's that this mod was born !!!**

As with most creations you need resources. This mod is no different. If you want to build a tepee and/or campfire you will need to hunt.
You will need buffalo hide for part of your tepee and you will need buffalo fat to start your fire. You can cook the meat and get some juicy ribs to sink your teeth into. Who knows what the horns could be used for!?

**!!! Special thanks to Nathan.S who generously animated the mesh for the buffalo  !!!**

Mobs are in most cases there for a reason, this is no exception. Starting with the buffalo mob and after finding a heard, you can hunt them down with your trusty bow.


PLEASE! Let me know in the forum if I have forgotten you here.
